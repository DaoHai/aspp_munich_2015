1) Data exploration

* clone repository to your home directory:

  git clone yourusername@python.g-node.org:/home/bartosz/lab_bench

* copy data to `data` subdir:

  cp ~/lab-bench-data/* ~/lab_bench/data

* set path for extra libaries:

  echo "export PYTHONPATH=/home/student/lab_bech/libs" >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc

* create a new branch (use unique names for your team):

  git checkout -b myteam_pairwise_correlations

* in the script we worked on during the lecture, calculate all pairwise correlations between all neurons (use nested for loops and plot the histogram)

* commit and push your branch back to `origin`:
  
  git push origin myteam_pairwise_correlations
